String is actually a class.
- we use String to store a series of characters
- As the Stirng is a class so we can use it like below:
    String name = new String("amar");
    System.out.println(name);
- Along with the above String can also be initialized as below:
    String name = "amar";  -- initializing the varible

Lets focus on the later one : String name = "amar" ;
- here name as a reference variable is stored in stack memory 
- it stores the location of the location like @101 in its value part (key-value ==> name - @101)
- and the actual value of the variable name is stored in heap which is "amar" and this value "amar" is stored in heap at location - @101



***HASHCODE***
- if you want to check and see the location of the String ref variable then we can do so by this:
        System.out.println(name.hashCode());
        O/P: 2997597



***CONCATENATE***
- if we want amar to be concatenated with other String like we want to concatenate with "hello"
- String do now allow us to use any other operator but for concatenate it allows us to use + operator



***OTHER METHODS***
- charAt() : to check the value of a character at a particular point
- concat() : this function works to concatenate the string 


***NOTE***
- so we can see the String is way too usefull for us so java gave this liberty to initialize it with ease: 
    String name = new String("amar");     <=====>   String name = "amar"
- we can use either with no issue.
- we can see the later one is easy
