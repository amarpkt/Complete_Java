Garbase Collection is Java helps in memory managment

let say a = 10;

later we changed it as a = 35;

now a is just a reference variable which was pointing to 10 but now to 35

10 is an old object and 35 is now a new object 
but at present 10 is not being pointed by any reference variable 
thus it will be removed by garbage collector later in Java
