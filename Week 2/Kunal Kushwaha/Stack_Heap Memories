There are two types of memories - Stack and Heap

a = 10 ; 

- here a is a reference variable
- 10 is the object

Now How it is stored in Memory

Refrence variable is stored in Stack
Actual object is stored in Heap

Note: 'a' which itself is in Stack, points towards the Heap memory location in actual.
