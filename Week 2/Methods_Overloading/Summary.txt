- initially we needed the add function to add only two values so we used this function:
    public int add(int n1, int n2){
        return n1 + n2;
    }
- later we thought to have the functionality to add three numbers so we modified it like this way:
    public int add(int n1, int n2, int n3){
        return n1 + n2 + n3;
    }
- now the condition is that we are not sure how many parameters we are going to receive from user like 2 or 3 we are not sure
- in that case we can have two methods:
    # For three parameters
    public int add(int n1, int n2, int n3){
        return n1 + n2 + n3;
    }
    # For two parameters
    public int add1(int n1, int n2){
        return n1 + n2;
    }
    in main:
    int r1 = obj.add1(3,4,5); or
    int r1 = obj.add(3,4);    

- Problem is that it's not dynamic in main class, we have to define which method to call like add or add1
- at this problem state, comes the solution as method overloading:
    public int add(int n1, int n2, int n3){
        return n1 + n2 + n3;
    }
    public int add(int n1, int n2){
        return n1 + n2;
    }

    in Main:
    int r1 = obj.add(3,4,5);  or
    int r1 = obj.add(3,4);
