Types of programming languages: Three Types
- Procedural 
- Functional
- Object Oriented


Procedural Programming Language
  - Specifies a series of well structured steps and procedures to compose a program
  - Contains a systematic order of statements, fucntions and commands to complete a task

Functional Programming Language
  - writing a program only in pure functions i.e. never modify variables, but only create new ones as an output
  - used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data, like ML
  - first class functions

Object oriented
  - revolves around objects
  - code + data = object
  - developed to make it easier to develop, deploy, reuse and maintain software



Static vs Dynamic Languages
Static: 
  - Perform type checking at compile time
  - errors will show at compile time
  - declare datatype before you use it
  - more control
  - Example: int a = 10 ; // values defines at compile time only

Dynamic: 
  - perform type checking at runtime
  - error might not show till program is run
  - no need to declare datatype of variables
  - saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime
  - Example: a = kunal; no issue at compile time and at run time a will be defined as string type

Based on above differences we can say now that the Java Language is STATICALLY TYPED Language.
