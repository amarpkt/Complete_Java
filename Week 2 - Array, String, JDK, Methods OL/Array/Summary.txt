we can save a value in a variable like:
    int i = 5;
    int j = 6;
    int k = 8;

Now we saw we needed three variables to store the above three values (5,6,7)
Now what if we can have a single variable which can store all the three values in a single variable

Here comees the array into picture:

        int num[] = {5,6,7} ;

Now here in num[] variable we are storing multiple values.
num with a square braces [] is what represents an array variable

NOTE: once you define an array then you can not change the size of the array:

        int num[] = new int[4] ; -- SIZE = 4 (Can not be changed) 


|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 7 | 2 | 4 |   ===> This is how in memory the array values are stored, in a continuous manner
|___|___|___|___|
  0   1   2   3     ===> This is how the indexing is done for an array.


*** Fetching values of an array:

         System.out.println(nums[1]);
Output = 7




*** Updating the value of an Array:
        nums[1] = 6;
        System.out.println(nums[1]);

Output: 6



*** Array Initialisation without assiging values:
        int nums[] = new int[4];  -- Size = 4
        System.out.println(nums[1]);
Output = 0



*** Drawbacks of an Array:
- Array inside java is an object
        int nums[] = new int[4];  --new keyword means an object creation
- Thus actual array will be stored in Heap memory
- And the size of an array is fixed is the one which we count it as drawback.



***Array Of Objects (Demo2.java)
- this should be clear that holding an array of objects is not possible, rather what we actually see is an array holding reference variables of actual objects. 

Example : Student class is ther with some instance variables like name, rollNo, & marks
- now we will create three objects like s1, s2 and s3 
- we will then store the reference variables like this:
        Student  students[] = new Student[3];
- post creating the students[] array we will populate it with the reference variable created for the three objects - s1, s2, s3
        students[0] = s1;
        students[1] = s2;
        students[2] = s3; 
- here students[] array is not an ARRAY OF OBJECTS rather it will hold the array of refernce variabls of actual objects.
