Enum: these are names constants.

Example: if we ping a server then we get certain status code: 200, 400 etc

So we cna create enums rather then creating objects 
Demo.java
enum Status{
    Running, Failed, Pending, Success;
}




Enum If  and Switch:
Demo2.java  --> If Else Demonstration and Switch Diff

In Switch we don't have to mention Status.Running or Status.Failed
Java know s means all cases are of Status type
