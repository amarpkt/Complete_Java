Polymorphism : Poly  +  Morphism 
Poly - Many
Morphism - Behaviour

    Compile Time Polymorphism                           Run Time Polymorphism
    (Eg. Method Overloading)                           (Eg. Metnhod Overriding)



## Why Method Overloading is an Example of Compile time Polymorphism?
Ans: Here in Method overlaoding the method binding is static and which method to call is determined at compile time via COMPILER


## Why Method Overriding is an Example of Run time Polymorphism?
Ans: Here in Method overriding the method binding is dynamic and which method to call is determined at run time via JVM


Rest things can be clarified in Dynamic Mehtod Dispatch
