Demo.java
- this is just for understanding relationship of parent and child. 
- we can see laptop extends Computer, that means laptop is a computer.

Demo2.java
- Here we can see that B class object is created and because of methpd overriding the show method of A got printed


Demo3.java
- we saw that refernce variable of type A but the actual object is of type B
    A obj = new B(); --Where B is a child class of A
- Here we can see that we're creating refernce of parent class and the actual object is of child Type
- This is called as Dynamic Method Dispatch
- RESULT: It will always print the method of child class

    A obj = new B(); ==> "in B Show"  ( where B is child and A is parent)
    A obj = new C(); ==> "in C Show"  ( where C is child and A is parent)
