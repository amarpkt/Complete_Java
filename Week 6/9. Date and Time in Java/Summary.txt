Date and Time in Java Application: 
Before Java 1.8 : we can work with Date and time using: 
    - java.util.Date  
    - java.sql.Date

Java 1.8:
    - Java.time

Java 8 introduced the much-improved java.time package (JSR-310),
 which is part of the new Date-Time API based on the ISO and Gregorian calendar systems.


working with java.util.Date & java.sql.Date:
- here using Date from util package allows us to use the same without passing any arguments.
        java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();
- while to use the Date from sql package we must pass an argument in Date function:
        java.sql.Date uDate= new java.sql.Date(time);

Working with java.time:
- here there are two classes which can be used to work with Date and Time.
    --> LocalDate
    --> LocalTime
- these classed have a common static function which is npw()
- this now() function is a static function thus no need to create an object unlike the util & sql package Date class where we need to create the object first
- thereafter we have multiple funciton as shown in Demo2.java which can be used as per the requirements.
