File Wtiter: To write something in a file.
- Here also java.io.* package would be used to work with file Writer.
- For writing we'll need two objects: 
    > One to work with file, like passing file name and location : File
    > one to write the data into the said file memtioned in file : FileWriter

- File file = new File(filePath);
- FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);

here file object reference is used to locate the file
here writer object reference is used to write the date into above file.
- on running the code in Demo.java, Output will be: 
            Java
            A
            a
            alien

- However if we want to not override the whole data but want to add a new data then we can use this: 
            File file = new File(filePath);
            writer = new FileWriter(file, true);
- Here true in the FileWriter constructor will make sure not to override the data but to add a new Data in the file.            





File Reader: 
- File reader work with class FileReader
- only thing tp note here is that reader.read() method is returning integer value.
- thus it will return 74, as the J is the ASCII value of 74

- if we want to hold J, rather than 74 then we need to convert it explicitly to character


Demo3.java: 
- here we will see how a character array is used to store the values of the file java.txt
- here this line: 
        reader.read(ch);
- this line is directly taking the values and pushing it in character array ch 
- and making the conversion implicitly        
- but in actual there is no int to char conversion taking place
- it's a functinality of read(ch) function to read the value and store directly in charactre array



NOTE: FileWriter
- while writing the data if we write JAVA then it gets stored as JAVA
- But if we write 65 and 66 then it gets stored as A and B 
- Here we can not see that same value is getting stored.
- The same issue is in BufferedWriter
- The same issue is sorted in PrintWriter with the use of println() method.

NOTE: FileReader
- Here the thing is revered, if we are storing the value as JAVA in a file
- then on using simply FileReader it returns ASCII values: 74, 97, 118, 97, 10
- and if we want actual value then we must convert it explicitly as char(i)
- This problem is not there in BufferedReader
- This is because we have one methof readLine() in BugfferdReader which makes the difference.
- Otherwise if we use same method FileReader.read() in BufferedReader case like BufferedReader.read() then it will also give same value 66 for B stored.
