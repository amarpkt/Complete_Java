optional Class: 

Demo.java: refer below code: 
          String name = names.stream()
                        .filter(str -> str.contains("x"))
                        .findFirst();
Here it gives error at this point as findFirst is expecting the value to be held in an Optional String rather than a normal String.
Why? : because findFirst() is of Type Optional.
And optional is a class introduced in Java 1.8
> it came into picture in Java 1.8 just to handle a very common exception -> Null Pointer Exception.
> When we try to perform an operstion on a null value then we get null Pointer exception.

> Optional is a solution for this.
When you try to print using this: 
        System.out.println(name.get());
> You will not get error for NUll Pointer but will get a not found something error.
> thi can be avoided by using this: 
              System.out.println(name);
> here you'll get as optianl.empty
> Or we can use this also: 
                System.out.println(name.orElse("Not found));
> Or you can use this directly:
          String name = names.stream()
                        .filter(str -> str.contains("x"))
                        .findFirst()
                        .orElse("Not foundd");
In this way you don't have to you Optional class: it mimics the Optinal class.
