We know java is having primitive data types : int, float, double etc
this makes it not purely OOPS language

There are certain frameworks which can only work with Objects.

Java has Wrapper class which is a sort of replacement for primitive data types of Java.

int --> Integer
char --> Character
double --> Double etc

these wrapper classes objects can be created and used inlike primitive data types

int num = 7;
System.out.println(num);

Integer num2 = new Integer(num);  //Boxing
Integer num3 = num;               //Auto-Boxing (Happening Automatically)
        
int num4 = num2.intValue();       //Un-Boxing
int num5 = num2;                  //Auto-Unboxing (Happening Automatically)

String str = "12";
int num6 = Integer.parseInt(str);  //Integer.parseInt is also a useful method
