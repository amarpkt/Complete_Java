Here we want to compare the differences in the two concepts which is method overloading and method overriding:


Method Overloading:  Demo.java
- in this part we can see that there are two methods in a single class.
- the two method differ in their arguments, or the datatypes
- here in Demo.java we can see that there are two methods named add and add
- same name but differ in number of arguments
- so we have overloaded the class with two methods with same name but depend on the requirements, 
    the respective method gets called itself.


Method Over-riding: Demo2.java & Demo3.java
- in Demo2.java when we call the child class object which is AdvCalc then there is no method found by the 
    name add(), thus it called parent class i.e. Calc class method add().
- in Demo3.java when we call the child class object which is AdvCalc then there is a method found by the 
    name add(), thus the child class method add() gets called and the respective output prints.
- this is called as method overriding.



Illustration: 
- I'm Amar and I'm child of my father.
- I don't have a phone with me as I'm not old enough to carry a phone.
- when someone asks me what phone I do have, i usually say I've Nokia 3310 which is originally my fathers phone.
- but when I'm old enough to carry a phone then I bought Motorolla phone. 
- now if someone asks me which phone I do have, I say I have Motorolla phone.
