Divide and Conquer: 
when we have a problem, then we divide the problem into sub problems
- then solve the sub problems 
- then merge the sub solutions into a parent solution


What if the sub problem is itself a huge problem
- then we divide it into sub-sub problems
- and so on till we get a smaller problem
