What are Data Structures:

primitive data types:
 int a = 5;
 String name = "Amar";

 So here we can see that we are storing the data in a variable a, name as per the data type like weather we want to store an integer or a String.

 Data Structure: It's a way to organize and store the data efficiently.
 Efficiently: means in terms of Performance
              means in terms of memory

So there are multiple application types: 
    - A Calculator
    - A banking application
    - A shopping application like Amazon

So based on the application type we use a respective Data Structure to store the data 

Algorithm: Set of instructions to perform computation.
like: 
 int a = 2;
 int b = 3;
 sum = a + b;
 Output sum;
