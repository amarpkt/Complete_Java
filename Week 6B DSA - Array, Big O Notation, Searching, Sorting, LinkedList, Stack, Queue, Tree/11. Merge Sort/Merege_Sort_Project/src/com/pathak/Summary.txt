Merge Sort: 
- Both quick sort and merge sort work on the principle of Divide and Conquer.

here we will divide the array into two - logically not physically.
- then divide the array till it reaches to single element array
- then merge the two arrays 
- then merge the merged arrays till you get the actual sorted array

 						5 8 7 2 3 4 --> Initial Unsorted Array
 						
 			5 8 7 						2 3 4
 
 5 8 				7 			2 3 				4
 
 
 5		8 			7 			2 		3			4
 
 
 
 
 5 8 		7 				2 3 				4					
 
 
 	5 7 8 							2 3 4
 	
 				2 3 4 5 7 8 --> Final Sorted Array
 				
NOTE: point to remember here is that once the left side is completed then right side starts.
- The two don't run in parellel as it seems in the example demonstrated above.
