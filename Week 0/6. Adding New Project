- For adding a new Project on Github we need to do three things:
1. Obviosuly crate a project local on your System.
2. Create a git Repo on GitHub Account.
3. Connect your Git Hub Repo with your  local setup of the project

On a low level we need to follow below steps:
- Obviosuly we're starting with creating a project in Local System.
- Then we need to create a repo on GitHub:
    > Profile > Repositories > New > Give a unique repo Name > Provide a meaningful Descriptio of Repository > assign privacy Public or Private > Add a readme fail > Create Repository
- Once created you'll get a connect command as like below: 
    echo "# Projects" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin git@github.com:amarpkt/Projects.git
    git push -u origin main
- Here important line is the second last one which will help us to link Local Repo with Github Repo
- now go to your local project setup, VS Code maybe.
- Check if git is initialized in the Folder, if not, use "git init" command to initialize the git.
- Then use this command to connect repo: 
    git remote add origin git@github.com:amarpkt/Projects.git
- Then check the status: 
    git status
- Obviosuly you'll see the messages in red that there are multiple files which needs to be added.
- Then use below command to add the files in staging area: 
    git add .
- then check the status, this time you'll see the files in green to be able to be added to local git repo.
- To commit the changes, use below command with a meaningful name:  
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
- Now push the changes to git hub repo
    git push origin main


One thing to note here is that, by default your local repo will create the master branch/
- I prefer it to look like a main branch rather than master branch 
- so to convert this names use this command before connecting local repo to git hub repo.
        git push -u origin main
