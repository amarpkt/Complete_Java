If the repo needs to be pushed from a new system then use below steps:
- example: in case you re install the windows in your laptop then we need to install all again
- like git 
- VS code
- Eclispe 


so in similiar ways we need to perform below steps to again start pushing the code from same laptop.

- Install Git form git-scm.com
	> check version
	> git --version
- use cmd or VS code to initialize your machine
	> check if it already exisits:
	> git config --global --list
	> if nothing pops up then use below command to set this up:
	> git config --global user.name "Amar Pathak"
	> git config --global user.email "amarpathak723@gmail.com"
	> again check with same command if this has been setup properly:
		git config --global --list
- now need to generate ssh key so that same system does not ask for password for repeatedly pushed code:
	> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "amarpathak723@gmail.com"
	> this will generate a ssh key in your local system in folder : C: user>amarp> .ssh folder
	> go to the the respective folder using the cmd or VS Code and then cat the id_rsa.pub file into your clipboard
	
- now go to github and add this SSH key to your account: 
githb > setting > ssh keys > add > name your title and paste the key there

- after pasting go to your local system and clone the project:
	> git clone git@github.com:amarpkt/Complete_Java.git
You're done.
