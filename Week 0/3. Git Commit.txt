let's add a file say firstCode.txt in your working directory
- now we can check the status : git status 
- it will show that there is one untracked file 

- now you need to add this file in staging area in order to pick this up while pushing the code to github
to add the file to staging area: 
        git add firstCode.txt
- now again check the status
        git status
- this will show that there are some changes to be commited and there you can see your file firstCode.txt

- now the file is in staging area and you can now commit this change to your local git repo
        command: git commit

- how often to commit : decided by project to project and company to company

- along with commit we need to paas a messae otherwise it won't be commited
        git commit -m "Initial commit"


now the changes are commited to your local repo
