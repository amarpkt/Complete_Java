Demo.java: 
- in class A we've a method named show(). 
- when we call Object of B, then it calls the method show() of A class
- This is possible because of parent child relationship.
- B is child of A, so all the methods of class A will be available to class B also.
- in similiar way when we call object of class B:
        B obj = new B();
- here with reference of class B object 'obj' we can call A method show()

then the output will be : "in A Show"



Demo2.java:
- here we're calling Object of B only.
- but the same method show() is also present in B class.
- then JVM will execute the show() method of class B only.
- Here JVM has overrided the show() method of class A which is parent class 

This is known as method overriding.
