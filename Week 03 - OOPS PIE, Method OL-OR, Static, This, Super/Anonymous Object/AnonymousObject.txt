Referenced Objcet v/s Anonymous Object

Refer Demo.java
-Here we can see that we're creating the object and storing the object refernce in a reference variable
    A obj = new A();

- here new A() is the actual object which is being stored in a reference which is obj
- so the object which gets stored in a reference is known as "Referenced Object"


Q: Does new A() is actually an object?
A: yes we can verify this in Demo2.java

Demo2.java
- Here we have created a class A and have added a constructor so that whenever an object is created a line gets printed
- now when we write new A() ; ====> we saw that the object is getting created in the output
- now we are not storing this object into any reference, and this type of object is known as "Anonymous Object"

Anonymous Object:
- this can not be reused
- used only once when required. Example:
    new A().show()
- as there is no reference variable used so we can not reuse the object.
