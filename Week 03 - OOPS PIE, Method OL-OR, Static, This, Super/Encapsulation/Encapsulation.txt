Encapsulation:
- here we will see how we can bind the data with methods
- in Demo.java we can see that there are two variables name & age in Human" class which is being directly accessed via "Demo" class
- But this situation as demostrated in Demo.java is not matching with the real world. No one shall be able to access the data directly. 
- That means we need to bind this data in such a way that one can acces but not directly.

- Here comes the requirement of Encapsulation of Data and methods

Demo1.java:
- We will make the variables first private so that the variables shall be accessible in the own class i.e. inside the Human class only.
- The moment we make the two variables private then it will throw an error in the Demo1.java class
    private String name;
    private int age;

Error: The field is not visible
Solution: we will use some public methods so that with the help of these methods we can use the private variable.
- once the variabls are privatem then we can create a public method getAge() and getName() to fetch name and age of obj object.


- In a similiar way we can use the set Methods to set the values - Demo2.java


- Thus we can see that we are able to assign the private variable values with the help of set Methods
and are able to fetch the values of private variables with the help of get Methods

- THUMB RULE: WHENEVER WE ARE INITIALIZING THE INSTANCE VARIABLE THEN MAKE IT PRIVATE AND ACCESS THOSE WITH THE HELP OF GET METHODS AND FETCH THEM WITH GET METHOD - getter and setter
