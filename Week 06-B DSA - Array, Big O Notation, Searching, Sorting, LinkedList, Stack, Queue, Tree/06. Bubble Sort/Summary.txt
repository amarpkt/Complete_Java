Bubble Sorting: 
- Here we create a bubble and get the largest element in the end 
- we continue the same iteration and create a two element bubble to push the largest element in the end.

example: 
    8 6 9 2 4 5
    
1st Iteration: 
    8 6 9 2 4 5
    6 8 9 2 4 5
    6 8 9 2 4 5
    6 8 2 9 4 5
    6 8 2 4 9 5
    6 8 2 4 5 9

2nd Iteration: (now exclude index 5 as it's already at right place)
    6 8 2 4 5 9
    6 8 2 4 5 9
    6 2 8 4 5 9
    6 2 4 8 5 9
    6 2 4 5 8 9

3rd Iteration: (now exclude index 4 as it's already at right place)
    6 2 4 5 8 9
    2 6 4 5 8 9
    2 4 6 5 8 9
    2 4 5 6 8 9

4th Iteration:(Now exclude index 3 as it's already at right place)
    2 4 5 6 8 9
    2 4 5 6 8 9
    2 4 5 6 8 9

5th Iteration:(Now exclude index 2 as it's already at right place)
    2 4 5 6 8 9
    2 4 5 6 8 9


Big O Notation for Bubble sort: O(n2) - (n square)
    - because we need to run two loops
        * one for the iterations
        * Inner loop for each iteration to compare the values and swap
Note: 
    - Not an efficient Algorithm
    - Easy to understand
