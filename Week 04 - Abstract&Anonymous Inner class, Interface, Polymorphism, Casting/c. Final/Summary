Final can be used with a varible, a method and a class as well.


Final Variable: Demo.java
- once a variable is declared final then the value can not be changed ever.
- if you've only declared but not assigned any value then you can assign only once.

final int num = 9;
num = 10; // Not Allowed

final int num;
num = 9; //Allowed
num = 10; //Not Allowed






Final Class: Demo3.java
- the class declared final can not be inheritted 
- no one can extend a final declared class
- use case: Demo4.java
    . Here in Demo4.java we can see that the owner of Calc class is "Amar" and there is a child class AdvCalc which extends Calc class
    . We can see by utilizing the feature of Method Overriding AdvCalc class can take credit by printing the owner name as "Naveen"
    .in order to avoid this we can make Calc class final and no one will be able to inherit the class Calc 






Final Method: Demo2.java
- this final mehtod also does the same job as final class
- final method is preventing method overriding 
- lets say you have multiple methods like owner(), show() etc. and you want to secure only owner() method rather than all then 
   we can use final method.
- here show method is just printing the class name only in which owner credit kind of thing does not exisit so we can leave 
    show() method non-final
