Upcasting & Downcasting: 

int i = 5;
double j = i;
sysout(j);  --> No Error as j can store by appending .0 
Ouput = 5.0

BUT:
double i = 4.5;
int j = i;
sysout (j); --> Error: Incompatible type conversion
Solution: 
int j = (int) i;
sysout(j); --> Conversion done but with some data loss





Demo2.java:
- A is parent and B is child class.
- now If we create object of B using reference of B then its a Downcasting and is allowed 

But if we call object of B using reference of A then it's not allowed but we have a solution:

A obj = new B();  ==> A obj = (A) new B();   ==> this is implicitly done. so no need to choose 2nd alternate

And if we try to use same object obj to call reference of B:
B obj2 = obj;     --> Not allowed --> as B is child and A is parent and solution is :
B obj2 = (B) obj; --> Allowed now
