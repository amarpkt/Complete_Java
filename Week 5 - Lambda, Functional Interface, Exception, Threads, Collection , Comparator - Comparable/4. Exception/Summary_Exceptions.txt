Exception class is a part of java.lang package and serves as the base class for all exceptions. 
It has two main cateogaries of subclass:
    1. Checked Exception: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time, means the compiler requires the code to handle
        them explicitly.
    2. UnChecked Exception: These are exceptions that are not checked at compile time. They are usually the result of Programming 
        errors and extend the "RuntimeExceptions" class 


Common Subclasses of Exception
    Checked Exceptions
        1. IOException:
            . Examples: FileNotFoundException, EOFException.
            . Occurs when an input-output operation fails.
        
        2. SQLException
            . Occurs when a database access operation fails.

        3. ClassNotFoundException
            . Thrown when a class cannot be found.

        4. InvocationTargetException
            . Used in reflection to wrap an exception thrown by an invoked method or constructor.
        
        5. InterruptedException
            . Occurs when a thread is interrupted while waiting, sleeping, or otherwise paused.

        6. CloneNotSupportedException
            . Thrown when attempting to clone an object that does not support the Cloneable interface.
    Unchecked Exceptions (Subclasses of RuntimeException)
        1. NullPointerException
            . Occurs when attempting to use an object reference that is null.
        
        2. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
            . Occurs when trying to access an array element with an invalid index.
        
        3. ArithmeticException
            . Occurs when an arithmetic operation goes wrong, such as division by zero.

        4. IllegalArgumentException
            . Thrown when a method is passed an invalid or inappropriate argument.

        5. IllegalStateException
            . Indicates that a method has been invoked at an inappropriate time.
        
        6. ClassCastException
            . Occurs when trying to cast an object to a subclass it does not belong to.

        7. NumberFormatException
            . Thrown when trying to convert a string to a numeric type and the string is not properly formatted.

        8. IndexOutOfBoundsException
            . Parent class for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.


    Error Classes (For Comparison)
    --> Errors extend the Error class, not the Exception class. Examples include:
        . StackOverflowError
        . OutOfMemoryError
        . AssertionError
