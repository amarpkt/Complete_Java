We've seen in Previous section that how we can use the Generics concept in ArrayList to make it TypeSafe. 
    ArrayList<Student>  list1 = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList<Employee> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
    
- We can see above how the two ArrayList are coupled with a specific type of Element Student and Employee.
- This way the list1 can be used to add only Student type objects and list2 can be used to add Employee type objects in the respective list.

Question: Can we use the concept of GENERICS with normal classes as well.
Ans: yes we can.
