Types of interface:
- Normal interface
- Functional interface (SAM interface)
- Marker Interface


- Functional interface is also called as SAM i.e Single abstract Method interface.
- Marker interface is a blank interface with no methods in it.

- All the methods in the interface are PUBLIC and ABSTRACT


Marker Interface: this is mainly to update to compiler about something.
Example: Seriliazation 
            - in this you can take the object and store the value of the object in the Harddrive. But How?
            - so in scenarios when we need to destroy the object then we can transfer the values of the object in the HD 
            - later when required with the same values stored in the Harddrive, we can recreate the object.
            - Example: Games data in phone.
Transferring the values from object to Harddrive --> Seriliazation
Transferring the values from Harddrive to object --> De-Seriliazation


by Default, every object is not allowed to do so, you can do the permission with the help of Marker Interface


Marker Interface - No Method
Functional Interface - One Method
Normal Interface - Multiple Method
