Demo.java :
- first we wrote or replaced new ArithmaticException by a new Exception name which is "NaveenException".   
- with this we intend to call the NaveenException in place of ArithmaticException.  
          try {
            j = 18/i;
            if(j == 0){
                throw new NaveenException("I Don't want to print zero");
            }
        }  


- but this alone won't do the job as this is expecting a new Exception class which is NaveenException. 
- So let's make a new class: 

        class NaveenException{

        }  

- but again is not suffice as the error is expecting a constructor with a string value in try block (See above):   throw new NaveenException("I Don't want to print zero");  
- so we will add a constructor:  

             class NaveenException{
                public NaveenException(){

                }
            }   

- now again this is not suffice as we need to make this class a replica of an actual Exception class or we can do so by extending the properties of an Exception class.  
- this can be done by extending throwable class because EITHER YOU CAN BUILD SOMETHING FROM SCTRACH OR INHERIT FROM PARENTS.  
- So here we're inherriting the thing from parent class  

          class NaveenException extends Throwable{
                public NaveenException(){

                }
            }   

- also in the end you need to add a ctach block with which handles the throw kwyword of NaveenException.
        catch (NaveenException e){
            j = 18/1;
            sysout()
        }
