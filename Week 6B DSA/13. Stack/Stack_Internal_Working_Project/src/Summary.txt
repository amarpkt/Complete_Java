Internal working of Stack: 
Demo.java: 
	- we need to declare an Array as we're using array to implement Stack DS
	- We need an index variable, for which we used top
	- we need a size variable to store the size of the array

	
Push - to add values
Pop - to remove values

POP: This is to remove the element but as it's Stack so it shall pop the top element 
	- thus so need to pass the element value or index, by default it shall pop top element.
	- here we need to return the element which we want to remove
	- thus we returned the element in Pop method
	- Also we need to reduce the value of top so that the element shall not get inserted again in Stack
	

Extras: 
	- We can also implement the isEmpty() and isFull() method alongside all to make it more efficient.
