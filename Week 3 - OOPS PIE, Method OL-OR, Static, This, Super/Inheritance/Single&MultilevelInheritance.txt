lets say we have a Calc and AdvCalc and now we want to build a class with very advance feature like "VeryAdvCalc.java"

--Refer Demo2.java
we can see we have added a new class VeryAdvCalc and ther we added only one feature which is power feature
- and in return only by extending the AdvCalc we got all the featuer because internally AdvCalc is also extending the Calc class
- thus in the end VeryAdvCalc has features of AdvCalc and Calc both


Calc >> AdvCalc >> VeryAdvCalc   ===> Multilevel Inheritance
Calc >> AdvCalc                  ===> Single Level Inheritance




Multiple Inheritance:
- Means one child having multiple Parent class 
- this one is not possible in Java - Not Allowed
- Solution to achieve multiple Inheritance is Interface.


Why not allowed ? 
- In a condition where if a class is having 2 parent: 
Example: Class A extednds Class B and Class C
- and we created an object of class A = obj
- we want to call a method show() which is present in both class B and C
- in this case we're at "AMBIGUITY" as class A is not sure which parent class to ask for method show(), from B or from C
- So to avoid any runtime failure java does not supports the Multiple Inheritance.
